# TestContextDump

## Problem to solve

See https://forum.katalon.com/t/kse-10-3-1-test-suite-collection-records-passed-test-suites-instead-of-test-cases/182954/5

Katalon Studio does not offer a feature that counts the number of Test Cases in a Test Suite Collection with breakdown of PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED. But some users still want that feature. What can I do? --- I am going to develop a custom class that offers the wanted feature.
